## Rootstocks modulate scion gene expression through interaction with the local environment

This repository containts the Jupyter notebooks used for the manuscript currently hosted at: .

Scripts are divided into 5 broad categories:
1. Normalization and analysis in DESeq2
2. Self-organizing maps
3. Relating gene expression to the local environment 
4. Functional annotation
5. Miscellaneous figures

In addition, the metadata for the RNAseq are provided that relate to PRJNA674915 and PRJNA915033.
